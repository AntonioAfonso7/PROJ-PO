WAREHOUSE SYSTEM


Project for OOP (Object Orientated Programming) in my second year @IST CompSci, that represents a fully functional Warehouse Management system, allowing the user to request 
various demands- such as creating a Partner associated to the Warehouse, creating a Product, set and change the date, make Transactions between the Warehouse and Partners (like 
buying, selling, breaking products or assembling them together) - in a flexible and simple interface (with a visual interface extension adapted in the code)
